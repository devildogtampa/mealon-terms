    <h2>5. Subscriptions and Billing</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Subscription Tiers</h3>
    <p>The App requires a paid subscription to access. Available subscription tiers are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Plan ($1.99/month):</strong> Auto-renewing monthly subscription with basic search features</li>

    <p>Subscriptions automatically renew each month unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Your account will be charged automatically on your Subscription Billing Date for all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate your subscription or account.</p>

    <h3>5.3 Payment Processing</h3>
    <p>Payment processing is handled by Google Play (for Android) or Apple App Store (for iOS). By subscribing, you authorize the applicable app store to charge all subscription fees to your payment method.</p>
    <p><strong>Please note that if you purchase a subscription through the Google Play store or the Apple App Store, the sale is final and we will not provide a refund.</strong> Your purchase will be subject to Google's or Apple's applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds.

    <p><strong>For Apple App Store users:</strong> You may cancel your subscription by managing your subscriptions in your iTunes Account settings.</p>
    <p>Cancellation is effective at the end of the current billing period. <strong>You must cancel your subscription before it renews to avoid billing for the next period.</strong></p>

    <h3>5.5 No Refunds</h3>
    <p><strong>Refunds cannot be claimed for any partial subscription period.</strong> We will bill the subscription fee to your payment method through Google Play or Apple App Store. You will only have access to the App while your subscription is active.</p>

    <h3>5.6 Price Changes</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to change subscription prices at any time. Any price changes will take effect following notice to you, which will be provided at least 30 days before the new price takes effect for existing subscribers.</p>

    <h3>5.7 Prices and Taxes</h3>
    <p>Prices include applicable local taxes unless otherwise stated. You agree not to hold us responsible for banking charges incurred due to payments on your account. If payment is not received from your payment method, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us.</p>
